A number n is called a factorial number if it is the factorial of a positive integer. For example, the first few factorial numbers are 1, 2, 6, 24, 120,
Given a number n, the task is to return the list/vector of the factorial numbers smaller than or equal to n.

Examples:

Input: n = 3
Output: 1 2
Explanation: The first factorial number is 1 which is less than equal to n. The second number is 2 which is less than equal to n,but the third factorial number is 6 which is greater than n. So we print only 1 and 2.
Input: n = 6
Output: 1 2 6
Explanation: The first three factorial numbers are less than equal to n but the fourth factorial number 24 is greater than n. So we print only first three factorial numbers.
Constraints:
1<=n<=1018

 ASNWER: 
class Solution {
    static ArrayList<Long> factorialNumbers(long n) {
        // code here
        ArrayList<Long> arr = new ArrayList<Long>();
        int i =1;
        while(true){
            long p = fact(i);
            if(p>n){
                break;
            }
            i++;
            arr.add(p);
            
        }
        return arr;
    }
    
    static long fact(int n){
        if(n==1) return 1;
        return n * fact(n-1);
    }
}

BETTER APPROACH:

class Solution {
    static ArrayList<Long> factorialNumbers(long n) {
        // code here
        ArrayList<Long> arr = new ArrayList<Long>();
       fact(1,1,n,arr);
        return arr;
    }
    
    static void fact(long i,long s, long n, ArrayList<Long> arr){
       
        if(s>n) return ;
         arr.add(s);
         fact(i+1, s*(i+1),n, arr);
    }
}
